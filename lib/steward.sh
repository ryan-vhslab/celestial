# A service with a `health:` path is the only thing on this box that can be
# asked, rather than guessed at, whether it is working - so it is asked, once
# per tick. ONE down tick is a restart, a deploy, a laptop lid; TWO CONSECUTIVE
# down ticks is a service that is not coming back on its own, and that is the
# point at which root hears about it. The count lives beside the nudge state
# because it is the same kind of fact: what was true last time this ran.
# RESOLVED PER CALL, never captured at source time. The suite points
# CEL_STEWARD_STATE at a fixture AFTER sourcing this file, and a path frozen
# when the library loaded meant every test counted down-ticks in the real
# box's state file - which is both a lie and a write to the live box.
