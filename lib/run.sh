# number: nothing guaranteed that directory had any relationship to the pull
# request, and nothing kept it current. On 2026-09-21 it sat at d2da692 while
# main was at 81022b5 - eighteen commits and a whole day behind - and produced
# three wrong conclusions before lunch: a branch measured as 3x slower than a
# "main" that predated lib/orphans.sh, and a reviewer of #75 reporting that
# lib/wslife.sh "does not exist on this branch" hours after it landed. Both
# answers were truthful about the wrong tree.
#
# So a reviewer gets a checkout of its own, DETACHED at the PR's head, in the
# manner scouts already get a worktree: a linked git worktree of the
# orchestrator's clone, which costs a fetch rather than a clone and which the
# orchestrator cannot move underneath it. Detached on purpose - nothing in it

## This review
You are reading a checkout of your own, detached at this pull request's head.
It is not the orchestrator's working copy and nothing moves it under you.

- repo: \`$1\`, pull request: #$2
- head you are reading: \`$3\` (in \`$5\`)
- base you compare against: \`origin/$4\` - say "origin/$4", never "main" as a
  directory, and anchor every claim about the base to that ref.

Before you conclude anything, check the head has not moved:
\`gh pr view $2 --repo $1 --json headRefOid\`. If it differs from \`$3\`, say so
in your verdict - you are reviewing an older head, which is a fact about the
review, not a detail. Nothing here is a branch, so there is nothing to push.

# (/proc/<pid>/cmdline) with what `cel run --dry-run` would launch now.

# run it rebuild the argv from role/workspace/product, never by re-splitting.
